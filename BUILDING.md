# Building with Make

## Dependencies

For a list of dependencies.

- Make
- [valgrind](http://valgrind.org/) for report
- [cmocka](https://cmocka.org/) for unittest

## Build

This project doesn't require any special command-line flags to build to keep
things simple.

Here are the steps for building in release mode with a single-configuration
generator, like the Unix Makefiles one:

```sh
make
```
